<h1>Favorite Movies From 2024 </h1>
<h2>Here are my top 3 favorite movies that I have seen in 2024 (so far) </h2>
<hr />
<h3>Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice</h3>
<p>This was a comforting nostaglia flick I got to see in theaters with my younger sister. Very funny and called back to the original in clever ways.</p>
<h3>Zone of Interest</h3>
<p>Had to watch it over a several day period because it was so dark and thought provoking. Terrifying sound design. Relevant to today's political environment</p>
<h3>Dinner in America</h3>
<p>Probably the most adorable and relatable romcom I have seen in ages. Showed life on the spectrum in a cute, hilarious way</p>
