<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a new web developer currently honing skills in HTML, CSS and Java. I have been based in Western Mass for the last 8 years but am origianlly from North Central Pennsylvania. 
  I have a dog named Sienna and I spend lots of time hiking and playing with her. I also love films and books. Recently Stardew Valley has been taking up most of my time, it is such a fun, cozy game!
